Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:


With a small number of simulations (10), the predictions were way of. The top three teams remained the same but the chance of winning dropped from 40% to 23% (for the range of 10 to 100 simulations)

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

It seems like the predictions stabilized after about 10000 simulations. So i would consider 10000 simulations as good enough.
