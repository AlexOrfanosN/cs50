As a reference i took the 50000txt. in order to get bigger numbers. that helped me have a better understanding of whats happening.
I run 10 times each one and i made an average
I disregarded the reversed()txt. because i didnt think it would produce relevant data.
I used Sorted 50000 and random 50000txt as best and worst case scenario.

sort1 uses: Bubble Sort

How do you know?: In the best case scenario Sort 1 and Sort 2 were almost the same and also the fastest. In worst case Sort 1 was very time consuming while Sort 2 was very fast.
So Sort 1 does seem to have the Big O and Big Omega discrepancy.

sort2 uses: Merge Sort

How do you know?: In the best and worst case scenario Sort 1 was the fastest. Sort 2 does seem to apply the Big O and Big Omega equivalence.

sort3 uses: Selection Sort

How do you know?: In the best and worst case scenario Sort 3 was average in speed. Sort 3 does seem to apply the Big O and Big Omega equivalence.
